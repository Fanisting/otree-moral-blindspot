<p>In this part, you are about to play another <b>two-stage game</b> for 7 rounds to earn points. All points will be exchanged to dollars as your payoff. Each point you earn is equivalent to $0.266. After reading the instructions below, you have to pass the comprehension test on the next page.</p>

<h4>Stage 1: Die-throwing Game</h4>
<p>The first stage contains the same die-throwing game from the former part. You should choose a side (i.e. "Up" or "Down") in mind and report the side after throwing a die. The correspondence of "Up" side and "Down" side can be seen at the following table:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <tr>
    <th>Up</th>
    <th>1</th>
    <th>2</th>
    <th>3</th>
    <th>4</th>
    <th>5</th>
    <th>6</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>Down</th>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h4>Stage 2: Payoff Adjustment</h4>
<ul>
    <li>However, after the die-throwing game, <b>a computer-based Artificial Intelligence (or "AI") will make an adjustment to your earnings in each round</b>.</li>
    <li>The adjustment will be either +{{C.scale}} points or -{{C.scale}} points</li>
    <li>The computer-based AI will choose the adjustment with some unknown probability that <b style="color:red;">take account of your report decisions</b></li>
</ul>

<h4>Procedures</h4>
<p>The detailed procedure for each round are following steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>make a choice of side totally in your mind between "Up" and "Down"</li>
    <li>throw the virtual die and get to know the number of the throw</li>
    <li>report the side that you have chosen in mind in Step 1</li>
    <li>the computer-based AI make an adjustment to your earning with either +{{C.scale}} or -{{C.scale}} points</li>
</ul>

<h4>Your Payoff</h4>
<p>Your payoff in each round is the sum of your earning at die-throwing game and the payoff adjustment.</p> 
<p>For example, if you got number "3" in die-throwing and reported "Down" side, and the payoff adjustment is +{{C.scale}}, your payoff in this round should be (4+{{C.scale}}) points.</p>
