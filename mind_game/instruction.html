<p>You are about to play a die-throwing game. In this game, you can throw a virtual online die 7 rounds for earning points. All points will be exchanged to dollars as your payoff. Each point you earn is equivalent to $0.266. </p>
<p>After reading the instructions below, you have to pass the comprehension test on the next page.</p>
<h4>Die-throwing Game</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The six-sided die has a different number from 1 to 6. <b>The pairs of numbers add up to 7 on the opposite sides</b>: 1 vs. 6, 2 vs. 5 and 3 vs. 4, and vice versa.</li>
    <li>We call the visible side facing up of any dice you throw the side "Up" and the opposite invisible side which faces down the side "Down".</li>
    <li>Note: the outcomes of the die are random, and the outcome displayed on the screen corresponds to the "Up" side. </li>
    <li>For instance, if the "Up" side is 1, the "Down" side of the die should be 6 (see the table below for all the sides.)</li>
</ul>
<table class = 'table table-bordered'>
    <tr>
    <th>Up</th>
    <th>1</th>
    <th>2</th>
    <th>3</th>
    <th>4</th>
    <th>5</th>
    <th>6</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>Down</th>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<h4>Procedures</h4>
<p>Each round consists of one throw of the die. Prior to throwing the die, you must choose one side between "Up" or "Down" in your mind. After the die-throwing, you will be asked to report which side was chosen in your mind. </p>

<p>The detailed procedures for each round are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>make a choice of side totally in your mind between "Up" and "Down"</li>
    <li>throw the virtual die and get to know the number of the throw</li>
    <li>report the side that you have chosen in mind in Step 1</li>
</ol>

<h4>Your Payoff</h4>
<p>In each round, the points you score depends on both the <b>number of throw</b> and the <b>side you report</b>. 
<ul>
    <li>If report "Up" during Step 3, you will receive points that are same with the number of throws.</li>
    <li>If report "Down" during Step 3, you will receive points that are same with the number of the outcome's "Down" side.</li>
    <li>For example, if the number of throw is "3" and participant A report "Down", the payoff would be 4 points. And the payoff is 3 points when the reported side is "Up".</li>
</ul>
